How to Use Pocket Jobs

Pocket Jobs is an innovative application that simplifies the job search process by enabling users to easily keep track of the jobs they apply for, along with relevant data and follow-up steps for each opportunity. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Pocket Jobs effectively.

Creating a Job Board

The first step is to create a job board, which is essentially a category of specific jobs you want to look for. For instance, if you are interested in pursuing a full-time nursing career as well as a small career in the culinary arts, you could create two different job boards - one for nursing jobs in the healthcare industry and another for culinary arts jobs.

To create a job board, simply input a title and short description, and then add default or custom columns that suit your preferences. For example, if you want to add a relocation column to your culinary arts job board, click on the add a column button and select the appropriate input type.

Pocketing a Job

Once you have created your job board, you can start pocketing jobs that you are interested in. To pocket a job, click on the "Pocket a Job" button and fill in the relevant information, such as job title, company name, and application deadline. You can also add follow-up steps, such as researching the company or reaching out to the employer, and set due dates for each step.

Viewing Pocketed Job Details

To view the details of a pocketed job, click on the leftmost circle icon on the job row in the table. This will take you to a dedicated page for that job, where you can edit the job data table, create notes, and complete or edit the follow-up steps.

Completing Follow-Up Steps

Within the steps section of a pocketed job page, you can mark the steps as complete or incomplete, edit or delete previous steps, and add new steps if needed. You can also view a list of your to-dos on the homepage, which includes all the steps you have created for the jobs you have pocketed, along with their corresponding due dates.

To summarize this application, Pocket Jobs is a fantastic tool for people searching for jobs who want to keep track of their job applications and follow-up steps in an organized and efficient manner.
